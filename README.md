# linked-list-example
A simple example about how to create a linked list from scratch in C++. This example also include how to draw it in a window using [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/).

## Dependencies

The linked list class has not any dependency. The following dependencies are only to draw them:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
```

## Installation

As usual for a CMake project:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
